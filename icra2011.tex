\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:into}
        GARNICS context
Previous work on related 3D perception: stereo, color, structured light, laser scanners
     (Image segmentation, object modelling)
     Our previous work using ToF cameras
     Need for next view planning
     Something (requirements) on manipulation of deformable objects

This article presents some work towards the validation of using a ToF camera for 
effectively detect plant leafs. The extracted information should be useful to
determine the 3D position with respect to a robot to execute interaction
actions with the plant like positioning measure intruments.

The article is structured as follows: in Sec.
